# EventBot
Spare time discord bot aiming to make managing community events easier  
This has been developed to be used primarly by https://cirkeltrek.eu/


## Dependencies
This app has been developed on top of the Node interpreter *8.9.4*.  
My template engine of choice is *Jade*, coming from a Python background & seeing as it is the most commonly used template engine, it seems like a safe bet.
